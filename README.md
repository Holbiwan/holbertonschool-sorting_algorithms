## **Introduction**

"Welcome to our project, where we explore C programming and how to arrange things in order. We use the C programming language to create different ways of sorting stuff, like numbers or names, so they're in the right order, like from small to big. We also check how fast these sorting ways work when we have more and more stuff to sort. It's like a journey to learn about C, sorting, and how to make things work better."


## **Sorting Algorithms**

The following sorting algorithms are included in this project:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

* Each algorithm has its own C file within the repository, containing both the algorithm implementation and an example usage.
* You can explore each algorithm's file to understand its working and analyze its time complexity and space complexity.


## **Tasks**


### 0. Bubble sort - 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
	The file 0-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm.

### 1. Insertion sort - 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O
	Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insert sort algorithm.
	The file 1-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm.

### 2. Selection sort - 2-selection_sort, 2-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.
	The file 2-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm.

### 3. Quick sort - 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O
	Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm.
	The file 3-O contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm
