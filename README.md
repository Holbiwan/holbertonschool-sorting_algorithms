## **Introduction**

Welcome to our project, where we delve into the world of C programming and sorting algorithms. In this endeavor, we harness the power of the C programming language to implement a variety of sorting algorithms. These algorithms play a crucial role in the efficient organization of data, be it numbers, names, or other information, into specific orders like ascending or descending sequences. Moreover, we explore the fascinating realm of Big O notation, which helps us measure and understand the efficiency of these sorting algorithms as they scale with increasing data sizes. Join us on this journey to uncover the elegance of C, the art of sorting, and the science of algorithmic efficiency.


## **Sorting Algorithms**

The following sorting algorithms are included in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

* Each algorithm has its own C file within the repository, containing both the algorithm implementation and an example usage.
* You can explore each algorithm's file to understand its working and analyze its time complexity and space complexity.
